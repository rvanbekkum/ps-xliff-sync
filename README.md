A module to keep XLIFF translation files in sync with a specified, automatically generated base-XLIFF file.

This PowerShell module is based off the [XLIFF Sync](https://github.com/rvanbekkum/vsc-xliff-sync) VSCode extension.

## Project Status

Initial version with support for XLIFF 1.2 (support for XLIFF 2.0 follows later).

## Prerequisites

You need to have Powershell 5.0 or newer. This module uses classes.

## Installation

You can install the module from PowerShell Gallery by running:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name XliffSync
```

## Usage

### Synchronize XLIFF Translations

The `Sync-XliffTranslations` function will synchronize translation units and translations for a specified base/source file and target file.
To use the function you will need to specify the path to the base/source file (`-sourcePath`) and a path to the target file (`-targetPath`) _or_ a target language (`-targetLanguage`).

An example usage:

```powershell
Sync-XliffTranslations -sourcePath "C:\MyProject\My Project.g.xlf" -targetPath "C:\MyProject\My Project.nl-NL.xlf" -findByXliffGeneratorNoteAndSource -findByXliffGeneratorAndDeveloperNote -findByXliffGeneratorNote -reportProgress
```

The function will try to find matching trans-units and translations within a target file as follows:

1. Finding trans-units:
> 1. By Id
> 2. By XLIFF Generator Note & Source (controlled by switch `findByXliffGeneratorNoteAndSource`)
> 3. By XLIFF Generator Note & Developer Note (controlled by switch `findByXliffGeneratorAndDeveloperNote`)
> 4. By XLIFF Generator Note (controlled by switch `findByXliffGeneratorNote`)

2. Finding translations:
> 5. By Source & Developer Note (controlled by switch `findBySourceAndDeveloperNote`)
> 6. By Source (controlled by switch `findBySource`)

3. Initial translation:
> 7. Parse from Developer Note (controlled by switch `parseFromDeveloperNote`)
> 8. Copy from Source if source-language = target-language (controlled by switch `copyFromSource`)

If no trans-unit or translation is found, the unit is added and its target node is tagged with `state="needs-translation"`.

Please check the documentation of the function for more information and the available parameters.

### Check XLIFF Translations

The `Test-XliffTranslations` function (alias: `Check-XliffTranslations`) will check for missing translations and/or for problems in translations in a specified XLIFF file.
To use the function you will need to specify the target file (`-targetPath`) and whether you want to check for missing translations (`-checkForMissing`) and/or problems in translations (`-checkForProblems`).
If you let the function check for problems, then you can use the `translationRules` parameter to specify which technical validation rules should be applied.

An example usage:

```powershell
$unitsWithProblems = Test-XliffTranslations -targetPath "C:\MyProject\My Project.nl-NL.xlf" -checkForMissing -reportProgress
```

When finished the function will report the number of missing translations and number of detected problems.
Translation units without translations will be marked with `state="needs-translation"` and translation units with a problem in the translation will be marked with a 'needs-work' state and an "XLIFF Sync"-note that explains the detected problem.
The function will return the translation units with problems, which you can assign to a variable (e.g., `$unitsWithProblems`) or omit, to have the output printed.

Please check the documentation of the function for more information and the available parameters.

### Get XLIFF Translation Files Diff

The `Get-XliffTranslationsDiff` function will compare an original and new version of an XLIFF file and produce a new XLIFF Diff file that contains all the translation units that were added or whose source text was changed.

An example usage:

```powershell
Get-XliffTranslationsDiff -originalPath "C:\MyProject\OriginalVersion.xlf" -newPath "C:\MyProject\NewVersion.xlf" -diffPath "C:\MyProject\Diff.xlf" -reportProgress
```

Please check the documentation of the function for more information and the available parameters.

### Apply Translations to XLIFF Translation Files

The `Set-XliffTranslations` function (alias: `Trans-XliffTranslations`) will apply translations to the translation units in a target file with a translation base from a source file.

An example usage:

```powershell
Set-XliffTranslations -sourcePath "C:\MyProject\translationSource.xlf" -targetPath "C:\MyProject\translationTarget.xlf"
```

Please check the documentation of the function for more information and the available parameters.
